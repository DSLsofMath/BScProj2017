\section*{Abstract}

This report describes the development of the learning material \textit{Learn You
a Physics for Great Good!}. The material was developed as part of a bachelor
thesis project at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers
University of Technology. The goal of the project is to create a text-based
learning material which presents physics with the help of the programming
concept \textit{domain specific languages}, where the domain specific languages
are implemented in the programming language, Haskell. Furthermore, the
pedagogical use of a learning material of this kind and how well physics and
domain specific languages can be combined are discussed.

The background of the project is the (for Computer Science and Engineering
students at Chalmers) mandatory physics course \textit{Fysik för ingenjörer}
which has had less-than-good exam statistics for several years. We believe one
factor for why Computer Science and Engineering students get bad results in this
course is that they find physics irrelevant in relation to the rest of their
education. We think this problem can be solved with a learning material bridging
physics and programming, both highlighting the relevancy of physics and invoking
an interest for it. An increased interest will hopefully lead to better
results in the course.

The learning material includes five chapters dealing with physical dimensions,
calculus, vectors, particle mechanics and applications of them. Each chapter
consists of Haskell-code combined with a descriptive text. Some chapters
construct domain specific languages from the ground up, while some applies
previously constructed domain specific languages on physical problems. The
learning material is published on a
website\footnote{\url{https://dslsofmath.github.io/BScProj2018/}} and its source
code is freely
available\footnote{\url{https://github.com/DSLsofMath/BScProj2018}}.

The report also describes the meetings and discussions conducted with
non-project members. Their purpose has been to improve the learning material
and to perform an informal evaluation of the completed learning material.

The conclusions are that domain specific languages can have a pedagogical use in
physics education. The rigorous nature of domain specific languages
makes the process of physical problem solving rigorous as well. We believe this
way of thinking can further the teaching if it's used in traditional physics
education.
