# Om ni, grupp 21, skulle se detta, lämna vissa av våra frågor obesvarade i presentationen! (Om ni inte tänkt besvara dem innan ni såg detta vill säga). Då går det nog bäst för både oss och er!

# Opponering

Tips till oss: prata långsamt så att det är tydligt...

Oskar göra första halvan och Björn andra halvan.

## Inledning

- Thank you for your presentation
- We will now ask some questions about your project to deepen our understanding of it

## Huvuddel (fem cyklerna)

Är indelat i "presentation" av frågan och dess bakgrund, och sedan frågorna själva. När det gäller modeller står det en presentation av dem. Det är allt där i som publiken behöver veta för att förstå. Om de när de presenterar skulle missa något enstaka del vi behöver, så har vi dem här.

- **Other modelling teqniques**
  - *Background*
    - In background of report
    - "The benefit of agent based modeling as
opposed to other modeling techniques is the fact that it shows emergent behavior"
  - *Questions*
    - What others are there?
    - How do they work?
    - Advantages and disadvanatges compared to multi-agent?
- **Limitations of emergence**
  - *Background*
     - In the theory about emergence
  - *Questions*
    - What do you mean by saying that emergence has provisonal status?
    - Why are study of emergent properties futile?
    - Are there other limitations?
- **quantity over quality**
  - *Background*
    - In the methods
  - *Questions*
    - Could you elaborate why you did this choice? (Vet redan svaret, men vi är listiga och låter publiken få veta)
    - When you found a very interesting model, s.a. tree growth, what do you think of developing only a few very much? How would the results differ?

**Preliminär gräns, tidigaste**
  
- **Drunkards walk**
  - *Background*
    - Agent is a person
    - Rule: each tick takes a step in a random direction
    - Both 1D and 2D
    - Result is that the root mean square for all agents is root of time.
  - *Questions*
    - We found it interssting that not 0 after a while. Why do you think that's the case?
    - What do you think about proving the property mathematically?
      - Advantages and disadvantages compared to a simulation?

**Preliminär gräns, senaste**

- **Airplane boarding**
  - *Background*
    - Image!
    - Passangers boarding airplane, each is an agent
    - What strategy to minimize total boarding time?
    - Result is that "wilma ordered" is the best, twice as fast as random
  - *Questions*
    - 500 lines of code. Risk for making an error?
      - How are they noticted?
      - How are the results affected?
    - Is it possible to mathematically find the best strategy? Pros and cons compared to what you did?
    - Is any strategy used in reality? Why, why not?
- **Tree growth**
  - *Background*
    - Image!
    - A tree that is growing
    - The agents are groups o' cells
    - Each patch has sun and nutrition
    - Grows in the most profitable direction
  - *Questions*
    - Very intersting that even with simple rules, looks very similar to reality. We would like to dive deeper into this model.
    - How is sunlight set for each patch?
    - How is the nutrition set for each patch?
    - Would it be possible to add rules for stability? How would they look?
    - "Best direction worth growing in".
      - What does it mean?
      - So that the model stops sometime?
    - Would it be possible to make it look like something else, e.g. a pine-tree or an oak? What rules do you think are needed, i.e., why did it become exactly a savannah tree?

Två andra modeller: school of fish och Kolam.

Helst ska frågorna vi ställer visa att vi läst rapporten grundligt. Men här finns ändå några universiella fråga i reserv.

- Is the purose the one you originially picked, or has it changed along the way? Why caused it to change?
- Why did you chose to work with this area?
- Taking a step back, what do you think was the most educational and intersting thing your learned?

## Avslutning (av skriftlig karaktär, dvs: stavfel, dålig struktur...)

- We think the report is well-written with very few grammatical and spelling mistakes. It was however too informal at times.
- Parts of the method could have been in theory.
- Missing how the modelling was done in practice. Not possible for us to re-do the study.
- The results-chapter was too concise, difficult to understand parts of it.
- The introduction was piqued our intersts! Made us look forward to read the rest of the report.
