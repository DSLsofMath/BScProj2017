# Om ni, grupp 21, skulle se detta, lämna vissa av våra frågor obesvarade i presentationen! (Om ni inte tänkt besvara dem innan ni såg detta vill säga). Då går det nog bäst för både oss och er!

# Opponering

Tips till oss: prata långsamt så att det är tydligt...

## Inledning

- Thank you for your presentation
- We will now ask some questions about your project to deepen our understanding of it

## Huvuddel (fem cyklerna)

- **Other modelling teqniques**
  - What others are there?
  - How do they work?
  - Advantages and disadvanatges compared to multi-agent?
- **Limitations of emergence**
  - What do you mean by saying that emergence has provisonal status?
  - Why are study of emergent properties futile?
  - Are there other limitations?
- **quantity over quality**
  - Could you elaborate why you did this choice? (Vet redan svaret, men vi är listiga och låter publiken få veta)
  - When you found a very interesting model, s.a. tree growth, why not develop it further?
- **Airplane boarding**
  - If they haven't presented it, we have to do it
  - 500 lines o' code. Risk for making an error?
    - How are they noticted?
    - How are the results affected?
  - Is it possible to mathematically find the best strategy? Pros and cons compared to what you did?
  - Is any strategy used in reality? Why, why not?
- **Drunkards walk**
  - We found it interssting that not 0 avergae. Why do you think that's the case?
  - Once again, what do you think about proving the property mathematically?
- **Tree growth**
  - Introduce it
    - if not done in pres, short recap
    - Make sure it is explained thouruglhy. Let them show a picture we have prepared.
  - Very intersting that even with simple rules, looks very similar to reality. We would like to dive deeper into this model.
  - How is sunlight set for each patch?
  - How is the nutrition set for each patch?
  - Would it be possible to add rules for stability? How would they look?
  - "Best direction worth growing in".
    - What does it mean?
    - So that the model stops sometime?
  - Would it be possible to make it look like something else, e.g. a pine-tree or an oak? What rules do you think are needed, i.e., why did it become exactly a savannah tree?

Två andra modeller: school of fish och Kolam.

Helst ska frågorna vi ställer visa att vi läst rapporten grundligt. Men här finns ändå några universiella fråga i reserv.

- Is the purose the one you originially picked, or has it changed along the way? Why caused it to change?
- Why did you chose to work with this area?
- Taking a step back, what do you think was the most educational and intersting thing your learned?

## Avslutning (av skriftlig karaktär, dvs: stavfel, dålig struktur...)

- We think the report is well-written with very few grammatical and spelling mistakes. It was however too informal at times.
- Parts of the method could have been in theory.
- Missing how the modelling was done in practice. Not possible for us to re-do the study.
- The results-chapter was too concise, difficult to understand parts of it.
- The introduction was piqued our intersts! Made us look forward to read the rest of the report.
