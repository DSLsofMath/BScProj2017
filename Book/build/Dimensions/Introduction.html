<p>This chapter is about dimensions, quantities and units. What’s the difference?</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>dimension</strong> is “what type of thing something is”. For instance, <em>length</em> is a thing, <em>area</em> is a thing and <em>velocity</em> is a thing. Furthermore, they are <em>different</em> things.</li>
<li>A <strong>quantity</strong> is something that can be <em>quantified</em>, i.e, something that can have a number associated with it. Examples are the distance between Stockholm and Gothenburg, the area of a soccer field and the speed of light.</li>
<li>A <strong>unit</strong> is a certain magnitude of something. 1 metre is for instance approximatly the length of your arm.</li>
</ul>
<p>What’s the relation between these? A <em>quantity</em> has a <em>dimension</em>. The number describing the distance between Stockholm and Gothenburg is of the type length. A <em>quantity</em> also has a <em>unit</em> that relates the number to a known definite distance. The unit of a quantity must describe the dimension of the quantity. It’s not possible to describe a distance with joule. However, describing a distance is possible with both metres and inches. Those are two different units describing a quantity of the same dimension.</p>
<p>The dimension of a quantity is often implicitly understood given its unit. If I have a rope of 1 metre, you know it’s a length I’m talking about.</p>
<p>There are 7 <em>base dimensions</em>, each with a corresponding SI-unit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Length (metre)</li>
<li>Mass (kilogram)</li>
<li>Time (seconds)</li>
<li>Electric current (ampere)</li>
<li>Temperature (kelvin)</li>
<li>Amount of substance (mole)</li>
<li>Luminous intensity (candela)</li>
</ul>
<p>The outline of this chapter is to first introduce dimensions on <em>value-level</em> (to print them nicely). Then we’ll do dimensions on <em>type-level</em> (to only permit legal operations). And finally we’ll combine those results to create a data type for quantities.</p>
<p>In science SI-units are prefered over all other units. Therefore we’ll only care about SI-units. Since we now have a one-to-one correspondence between dimensions and units, only one is really needed!</p>
<p>Let’s start with value-level dimensions.</p>
