<h1 id="about-this-tutorial">About this tutorial</h1>
<p>You’ve arrived at <strong>Learn You a Physics for Great Good</strong>, the #1 stop for all your beginner-to-intermediate needs of learning <strong>Physics</strong> through the use of <strong>Domain Specifc Languages</strong> (hereinafter DSLs (mostly but not always)).</p>
<p>This book was written as a <a href="https://github.com/DSLsofMath/BScProj2018">bachelor’s thesis project</a> at Chalmers University of Technology as an offshoot of a bachelor’s level elective course <a href="https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath"><em>Domain Specific Languages of Mathematics</em></a>. The goal of the the project and the reason for the existance of this book, is to help primarily CS students learn physics better. We think that the use of domain specific languages to teach the subject will help set these students in the right mindset to learn physics efficiently and properly. An observed problem has been that students base their mental models completely or partially on intuition and incorrect assumptions, instead of on definitions and proved theorems where validity is ensured. This may be a bad habit stemming from the way math and physics is taught in earlier stages of the education, and we think that DSLs will inherently force students into the right mindset for learning this subject well! Further, many textbooks on physics are incredibly thick and boring, so we’ve decided to emulate the great and good <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a> in order to provide som comic relief in between all the dramatic definitions.</p>
<p>In this book, we will study physics through the lens of DSLs. We will need to pay close attention to definitions, throughly ponder any non-trivial syntax, and prove that the things we do are actually correct. The areas covered include such things as: dimensional analysis, vectors, calculus, and more!</p>
<p>The book is aimed at you who have some knowledge of <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. If you know what a <code>class</code> and an <code>instance</code> is, you’re probably good to go! Even if you don’t we’re sure you could pick it up as we go. We believe in you!</p>
<h1 id="so-whats-a-dsl">So what’s a DSL?</h1>
<p>In general, a domain specific language is simply a computer language for a specific domain. It’s NOT a synonym for <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/online-preface.html">jargon</a>! DSLs can be specialized for markup, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"><em>HTML</em></a>; for modeling, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form"><em>EBNF</em></a>; for programming, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29"><em>Bash</em></a>; and more.</p>
<p>The languages we will construct will mostly concern modeling of physics and mathematics. We will create data structures in Haskell to represent the same physics calculations that we write on paper, in such a way that we can write functions to, for example, analyze the expressions for validity.</p>
<p>Look, we’ll demonstrate. Let’s say we want to model a language that is a subset to the common algebra we’re all familiar with. Our language will consist expressions of a single variable and addition. For example, these are valid expressions in such a language:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x + x + x + x\]</span></p>
<p>When implementing a DSL, we typically start with modeling the syntax. Let’s first declara a data type for the language</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode literate haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb2-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">data</span> <span class="dt">Expr</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>Then we interpret the textual description of the language. “Our language will consist expressions of a single variable and addition”. Ok, so an expression can be one of two things then: a single variable</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode literate haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3-1" data-line-number="1">  <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dt">X</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>or two expressions added together.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode literate haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb4-1" data-line-number="1">  <span class="fu">|</span> <span class="dt">Add</span> <span class="dt">Expr</span> <span class="dt">Expr</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>And that’s it, kind of! A DSL without any associated functions for validation, symbolic manipulation, evaluation, or somesuch, is really no DSL at all! We mush DO something with it, or there is no point!</p>
<p>One thing we can do with expressions such as these, is compare whether two of them are equal. Even without using any numbers, we can test this by simply counting the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>s! If both expressions contain the same amount of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>s, they will be equal!</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode literate haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="ot">eq ::</span> <span class="dt">Expr</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Expr</span> <span class="ot">-&gt;</span> <span class="dt">Bool</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-2" data-line-number="2">eq e1 e2 <span class="fu">=</span> count e1 <span class="fu">==</span> count e2</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-3" data-line-number="3">  <span class="kw">where</span> count <span class="dt">X</span>           <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="dv">1</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb5-4" data-line-number="4">        count (<span class="dt">Add</span> e1 e2) <span class="fu">=</span> count e1 <span class="fu">+</span> count e2</a></code></pre></div>
<p>We can now test whether our expressions are equal.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-1" data-line-number="1">ghci<span class="fu">&gt;</span> eq (<span class="dt">Add</span> (<span class="dt">Add</span> <span class="dt">X</span> <span class="dt">X</span>) <span class="dt">X</span>) (<span class="dt">Add</span> <span class="dt">X</span> (<span class="dt">Add</span> <span class="dt">X</span> <span class="dt">X</span>))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb6-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="dt">True</span></a></code></pre></div>
<p>And NOW that’s it (if we want to stop here)! This is a completely valid (but boring) DSL. We’ve modeled the syntax, and added a function that operates symbolically on our language. This is a very small and simple DSL, and you’ve likely done something similar before without even realizing you were constructing a DSL. It can really be that simple</p>
<p>In other DSLs we may also look at evaluation and the semantics of a language, i.e. what is the actual type of the result when we <em>evaluate</em> or “compute” our expressions.</p>
<p>Throughout this book we’ll construct and use DSLs in many different ways. Different parts of the physics we look at will require different DSL treatments, basically. There is no <em>one</em> model to use for all DSLs.</p>
<h1 id="what-you-need-to-dive-in">What you need to dive in</h1>
<p>To just follow along and implement the same stuff we do, a single document loaded into GHCI will do. For this, you just need to install the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to automatically install any required dependencies, like <a href="https://github.com/DSLsofMath/Hatlab"><em>Hatlab</em></a> which will be used later on, install <a href="https://haskellstack.org">Stack</a>. Stack is a build system that will automatically get dependencies and build the project for you. If you want to build the code the same way we do, this is what you’ll need. With Stack installed and <a href="https://github.com/DSLsofMath/BScProj2018">our repository cloned</a>, enter the <code>Physics</code> directory and type <code>stack build</code>. Stack should now download and compile all necessary dependencies, such that they are avaiable when you load a module in GHCI.</p>
<h1 id="if-you-need-to-sharpen-up-your-skills">If you need to sharpen up your skills</h1>
<p>If you need to freshen up on your Haskell, <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</a> is a great book that covers all the important stuff in a humorous manner that really holds your attention.</p>
<p>If you still don’t really get what DSLs are all about, try reading the <a href="https://github.com/DSLsofMath/DSLsofMath/tree/master/L/snapshots">“notes” (almost a full book really) for the course on DSLs of math at Chalmers</a>. If you’re studying at Chalmers, even better to actually take the course!</p>
<p>If there’s some part of the material that you still think is unclear (or maybe even wrong? Blasphemy!), please <a href="https://github.com/DSLsofMath/BScProj2018/issues">open an issue on the github repo!</a>. We’ll look into it!</p>
